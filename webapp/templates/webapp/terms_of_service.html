The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by
teachoo. teachoo has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content,
privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, teachoo will not and
cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you

numbers and symbols) with your account. teachoo will not be liable for any loss or
damage arising from your failure to comply with this instruction. You must notify teachoo
immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

use.</p>

<p class="lead">Open Source Licenses</p>
<p>The Teachoo Service and Applications may contain or be provided together with open

terms, which can be found at <a>http://www.teachoo.com/about/open_source_tos</a> and/or in

<p class="lead">General Terms</p>
<p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of
California without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or
country of residence. Unless submitted to arbitration as set forth in the following
paragraph, all claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with the Service
will be brought solely in Santa Clara County, California, and you consent to the jurisdiction
of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.
</p>
<p>For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) under these Terms
where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting
relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration.
The party electing such arbitration shall initiate the arbitration through an established
alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The
ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall
be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, as
selected by the party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any
personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the
parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in
any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>These Terms are the entire and exclusive agreement between Teachoo and you regarding
the Service (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with Teachoo
that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and
replace any prior agreements between Teachoo and you regarding the Service.</p>
<p>The failure of Teachoo to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed
a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held
to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full
force and effect.</p>
<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time. The most current version will always be on
this page (or such other page as the Service may indicate). If the revision, in our sole
discretion, is material we will notify you via posting to our website or e-mail to the email
associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Service after those
revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
